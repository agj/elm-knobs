# elm-knobs polygon example

An example of several types of knobs used in conjunction to make a panel that
controls the rendering of an SVG drawing.

## How to run

This is a simple example contained in a single Elm file, so you can use Elm's
`reactor` command to try it out. Make sure you have Elm 0.19.1 or above
installed, get this repo, navigate to this folder and run the following command.

```sh
elm reactor
```

Reactor should start a server and show you a URL. Open it in your browser and
navigate to `Main.elm` to see the running example.

You can press `Ctrl+C` to stop reactor.
