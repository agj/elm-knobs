# elm-knobs polygon example

This is a simple example contained in a single Elm file, so you can use Elm's `reactor` command to try it out. Make sure you have Elm 0.19.\* installed, get this repo, navigate to this folder and run the following command.

```sh
elm reactor
```

Reactor should start a server and show you a URL. Open it in your browser and navigate to `Main.elm` to see the running example.
